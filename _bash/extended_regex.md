The -r option in the sed command enables extended regular expressions. Here's a breakdown of the sed command and the -r option:

- `sed`: The stream editor utility for parsing and transforming text.
- `-r`: Enables extended regular expressions. In some versions of sed, this option is `-E` instead of `-r`.

With the `-r` option, you can use extended regular expressions in your sed commands. 

Extended regular expressions provide additional functionality compared to basic regular expressions, such as:
- **support for the `+` and `?` quantifiers**
- **the use of parentheses for `grouping expressions`**
