## one example of resolver configs

```bash
[18:41:23] ➜  ~ cat /etc/resolvconf.conf
# Configuration for resolvconf(8)
# See resolvconf.conf(5) for details

resolv_conf=/etc/resolv.conf
# If you run a local name server, you should uncomment the below line and
# configure your subscribers configuration files below.
#name_servers=127.0.0.1


# Mirror the Debian package defaults for the below resolvers
# so that resolvconf integrates seemlessly.
dnsmasq_resolv=/var/run/dnsmasq/resolv.conf
pdnsd_conf=/etc/pdnsd.conf
unbound_conf=/etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/resolvconf_resolvers.conf
[18:52:34] ➜  ~ cat /var/run/dnsmasq/resolv.conf
