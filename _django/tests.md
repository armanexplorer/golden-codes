## TransactionTestCase

Note that we have to use `TransactionTestCase` and not `TestCase`. `TestCase` wraps every test inside a transaction block which gets rolled back at the end of the test. This is not suitable for our tests, which rely on having control over the outer transaction block. `TransactionTestCase` doesnâ€™t wrap anything in a transaction, so our code can actually make changes to the test database.
