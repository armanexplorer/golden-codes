title: what is select_for_update 
---

Returns a queryset that will lock rows until the end of the transaction, generating a `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SQL` statement on supported databases.

Djangoâ€™s `select_for_update` will release the lock when the outermost transaction it is inside gets committed

Locks in `PostgreSQL` are granted to a database `connection`
