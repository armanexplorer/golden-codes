# Tag ID

[Defininition](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/12326985)
Tag ID: A tag ID is an identifier that you put on your page to load a given tag. A single tag can have multiple tag IDs. You'll notice a "main" ID displayed.

If you combine or split your tags, the main tag ID displayed in the tagging instructions snippet can change. You don’t need to retag your page if this happens. As long as you have one of the tag IDs on the page, it will load the same tag. If you remove a destination, it doesn’t change existing tag IDs.
