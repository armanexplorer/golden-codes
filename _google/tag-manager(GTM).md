Google Tag Manager lets you configure and deploy tags from Google products and third parties.

Tags are designed to give you the ability to instrument your web pages and mobile applications to send data when some kind of event occurs. This data can include information about the type of event and parameters that describe information about the event.

# Triggers
In Google Tag Manager, tags fire based on events, such as when a form is submitted or when a video is played. Triggers are used to listen for these events, and they govern when a tag is fired or blocked.

# Add data layer
A data layer allows you to store and access data that your tags can use. Use a data layer in elaborate tagging scenarios.

# Server-side Tagging
Server-side tagging is the key to migrate away from third-party cookies. A tagging server lets you create, write, and store cookies on your own server. Bonus: You'll improve your website performance!
