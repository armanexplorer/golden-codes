title: what is Monkey Patch?
---

In computer programming, monkey patching is a technique used to dynamically update the behavior of a piece of code at run-time. It is used to extend or modify the runtime code of dynamic languages (e.g. Smalltalk, JavaScript, Objective-C, Ruby, Perl, Python, Groovy, etc.) without altering the original source code.
